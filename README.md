# AlgoRave

The Algorithmic and Generative Music Club (also known as the AlgoRave Club) is an on campus club dedicated to the performance of improvised electronic music through the technique of live-coding.

We primarily use a Python library called FoxDot (https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot) which interfaces with the SuperCollider interpreter and synthesis engine.

Here is a video demonstration of some live-coding jams:

Keep in mind, all the sounds you hear are being generated and manipulated in real time entirely through the code seen on screen.  No additional external controllers are used and no pre-redered loops are being triggered.  All arrangements are crafted from the ground up algorithmically.
