# AlgoRave

The Algorithmic and Generative Music Club (also known as the AlgoRave Club) is an on campus club dedicated to the performance of improvised electronic music through the technique of live-coding.

We primarily use a Python library called FoxDot (https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot) which interfaces with the SuperCollider interpreter and synthesis engine.

Here is a video demonstration of some live-coding jams:

Keep in mind, all the sounds you hear are being generated and manipulated in real time entirely by the code seen on screenâ€”the music has not been overdubbed, it is as it would be heard live.  No additional external controllers are used and no pre-rendered loops are being triggered, all synth sounds are achieved by controlling SuperCollider synthdefs from the Python interpreter via Open Sound Control. All arrangements are crafted from the ground up algorithmically.
